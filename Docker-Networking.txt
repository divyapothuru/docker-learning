DOCKER-NETWORKING:
------------------
1) container-1 needs to talk with container-2
2) Container-1 needs to be isloated from container-2

In order to communicate between each other it needs to connected by network.

In host it will be having ETH0(Some IP Address) same as with container it has EHT0(some different IP address)--> so it wont communicate each other their will N/W error 
So in order to communicate b/w host & container--> we need to have VIRTUAL ETHERNET - DOCKER0
IF anyone deletes this VETH then there wont be any communication between the host and container and application inside the container--no internet.-->THIS IS 1)BRIDGE NETWORKING
2)HOST NETWORK:this is not secure because the docker and host share same network and ip address so it is not secure.
3)OVERLAY NETWORK: In container orchestration this is more usefull,If we have multiple hosts then you need to build clusters and inorder to have communication between these overlay network will be usefull.
